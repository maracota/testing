# SDSU-IV Library history
From its inception, the SDSU Imperial Valley campus has included library services. In the California State 1959-1960 budget, Governor Edmund Brown allocated $47,000 for "an off-campus resident center for teacher education in Imperial Valley." CITATION. That fiscal year budget included a line for library staff. "Library, professional and clerical", 0.8.
A March, 1960 report stated that, "Library facilities are being rapidly established. As of February 18, 1960, 1700 volumes of books and 245 pamphlets were available for student and faculty use. Additional books and materials are on order. At present, the library is under the direction and supervision of half-time librarian.” CITATION (p4, uncatalogued report: “Report on off-campus residence centers”, March 1, 1960; in unlabeled folder in file labeled “Campus Historical Documents”)
